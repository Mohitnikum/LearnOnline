What is Flow of code execution in JavaScript?

-The Execution Context contains the code that's currently 
 running, and everything that aids in its execution. During
 the Execution Context run-time, the specific code gets 
 parsed by a parser, the variables and functions are stored
 in memory, executable byte-code gets generated, and the 
 code gets executed.

 -Note that the code in your web documents is generally 
 loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page.
 Errors may occur if JavaScript is loaded and run before
 the HTML and CSS that it is intended to modify.
