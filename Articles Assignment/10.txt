What is JavaScript Functions?

-A JavaScript function is defined with the function
 keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores,
 and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform 
a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when
 "something" invokes it (calls it).
