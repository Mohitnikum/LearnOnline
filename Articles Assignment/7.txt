What is Media Query?

-Media queries are a key part of responsive
 web design, as they allow you to create different
 layouts depending on the size of the viewport,
 but they can also be used to detect other things
 about the environment your site is running on,
 for example whether the user is using a touchscreen
 rather than a mouse.
